        <p>The reality of the 1965 war was a stalemate that ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire,
             though both India and Pakistan claimed victory and suffered thousands of casualties

             that led to the creation of Bangladesh. It officially began on December 3, 1971—when

            the disputed region. Pakistani soldiers sneaked into Indian territory and took control 
            of important mountain positions.
